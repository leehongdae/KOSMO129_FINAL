Creat-React-App 만들기 
----------------------------------

1. react_cra 폴더 만들기 

2. nmp init 하기 
C:\00.KOSMO129\51.react\react_cra>npm init -y  >>>> package.json 생성됨

{
  "name": "react_cra",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}

3. create-react-app 설치하기 
C:\00.KOSMO129\51.react\react_cra>npm install create-react-app -g --save


4. CRA 로 App 만들기  
C:\00.KOSMO129\51.react\react_cra>create-react-app client
============================================= 택1
C:\00.KOSMO129\51.react\react_cra>mkdir client
C:\00.KOSMO129\51.react\react_cra>cd client
C:\00.KOSMO129\51.react\react_cra\client>create-react-app .

5. 실행하기 
C:\00.KOSMO129\51.react\react_cra>cd client

C:\00.KOSMO129\51.react\react_cra\client>npm start


http://localhost:3000/ 자동으로 react 초기 페이지 나옴 




react 에서 사용할 ES6 자바스크립트 문법
===============================================

1. const

2. let 

3. template string : `(백틱)

4. module 
	ES6
		export
		export default

		import xxx from './화일이름' >>>>> 리액트

	CommonJS 
		exports
		module.exports
		
		require('화일이름'); >>>>> node.js

5. arrow function
	(파라미터1, 파라미터2.. n) => {}

	호이스팅 : hoisting

6. spread operator
	...변수명
	first, finish
	...rest

7. Asynchronous  : like ajax
	fetch() ~ then()   : 한세트
	async / await  : 한세트
		async () =>  await 함수()
	new Promise() 
		pending
		fulfilled
		rejected
		settled

Success! Created client at C:\00.KOSMO129\51.react\react_cra\client
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd client
  npm start

Happy hacking!

Starting the development server...

One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.

You can now view client in the browser.

  On Your Network:  http://192.168.0.52:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
